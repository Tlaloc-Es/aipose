    A subclass of FrameManagerBase that uses YOLOv7 model to make predictions on each frame.

    Attributes:
        model: The YOLOv7 model used for predictions.

    Methods:
        __init__(): Initializes a new instance of the FrameYoloV7 class and sets the model to YOLOv7Pose.
        before_read_frame(): Overrides the before_read_frame method of FrameManagerBase, empties the GPU cache before reading the next frame.
        frame_received(frame: ndarray) -> ndarray: Overrides the frame_received method of FrameManagerBase, applies the model to the frame and processes the result.
        on_predict(frame: ndarray, prediction: List[YoloV7PoseKeypoints], image_tensor: ndarray) -> None | ndarray:
            This method is called after the prediction is made, can be overridden in the subclass for additional processing of the result.
